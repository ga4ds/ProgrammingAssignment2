## The functions in this file create and cache a matrix and its inverse.


## makeCacheMatrix creates the matrix to be stored.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve returns the inverse of the cached matrix.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    ## Check to see if the matrix has been changed.
    ## Check to see if the inverse has already been calculated.
    ## The pre-calculated result is returned.  
    ## The inverse is computed and cached and the result returned.
